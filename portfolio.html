            I developed a tool to import bus routes and timetables into the Aimsun microsimulation software package using data provided in the Traveline National Dataset. The bus timetable data is first converted from an XML format into CSV files which are then processed to generate bus routes and daily timetable information within Aimsun.

          <p>
            I developed a tool to automate the creation of walking and cycling isochrones using QGIS, OpenStreetMap data, and the GRASS vector network analysis toolkit. Previously, isochrones were created using Microsoft Publisher on the basis of manual measurements taken on Google Maps. By developing a GIS-based solution to this task I improved the quality and presentation of the output maps and significantly decreased the time taken to produce them.

            A common task I encountered at Fore Consulting was estimating the distribution of vehicle trips from development sites. When I joined the company this processes was undertaken manually and involved running several hundred manual direction queries in Google Maps to determine the likely routes people might take between the development site and their places of work or vice versa.
          </p>
          <p>
            I developed a program using the Google Maps API to automate this process.

            For my Masters Dissertation, I analysed the likely impact that the initial proposals of the 2018 Westminster parliamentary boundary review would have had upon the results of the 2015 and 2017 general elections as well as the level of electoral bias present in each election. Ultimately, it sought to examine the boundary review would disproportionately benefit one party over another.

            In this project, I investigated whether rates of limiting long-term illness varied between census wards in Merseyside based on the proximity to motorways and data from the 2001 census.
          </p>
          <p>
            To achieve this, I created a 5km buffer of the motorways running through Merseyside and then utilised a simple area-based interpolation to estimate the populations within and outside the buffer.

            In this project, I compared the difference in results between two methods of land classification: the British land capability assessment (LCA), and a Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE).

          <p>
            To achieve this, I had to accurately implement the LCA and then devise a suitable MCE to compare it against. As part of this MCE I undertook a pairwise comparison between the different factors considered and implemented the analytical hierarchy process (AHP).

            In this project, I explored the ways in which crime mapping techniques can be used to highlight the geographies of burglary and considered which mapping techniques provide the most utility for identifying crime hotspots.
          </p>
          <p>
            This involved implementing several different crime mapping techniques including Gi* statistics, kernel density estimation, and the Geographical Analysis Machine.

The Marker Cluster plugin is utilised to cluster points together at small scales.

            As well as showing the locations of the plaques, the map also displays additional information for each plaque in an info window including the plaques message, sponsor, and date of placement.

            The data can be viewed as raw points, clusters of points, as a choropleth map, or as a heatmap. Accompanying each method of data visualisation is a brief commentary discussing the utility and limitation of each method.

          <p>
            This project was the final project for the Advanced Java module during my master's degree. It is a program which allows the user to compare how different map projections distort the world in different ways. It works by re-projecting a shapefile to a number of different coordinate reference systems. It also includes a grid and a set of Tissot's Intricacies to better demonstrate the distortion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program was coded in Java utilising the GeoTools library. In order to code the program I first had to independently learn GeoTools through its (less than ideal) documentation as GeoTools was not taught in the module.
