          <p>
            I am currently employed as a graduate transport planner at Fore Consulting. Within this role I am responsible for the production of transport assessments and travel plans and have worked on many developments of varying sizes throughout England.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am also responsible for the development and introduction of GIS tools and processes into the companies workflows. Notably, this has included the development of a program to automate the estimation of the distribution of vehicle trips from development sites using the Google Maps API which has greatly expatiated this process, freeing up time for other work and preventing potential error associated with undertaking this process manually. I have also developed a method of automatically generating accessibility isochrones for proposed developments by processing data from Open Street Map with pgRouting and QGIS. More generally, I have introduced QGIS as a superior tool to produce the figures required for transport assessments and travel plans, resulting in more accurate and professional figures in these reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            These accomplishments demonstrate my ability to structure and write complex reports and work efficiently to deadlines, both independently and as part of a larger team. My work introducing GIS to the company has demonstrated my ability to independently research and interpret complex concepts and to apply and pass on this knowledge to colleagues.

          <p>
            I worked at Spire Leeds Hospital for over 4 years and undertook a wide range of jobs and responsibilities within multiple departments of the hospital including the NHS and self-pay departments, business admin, and marketing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I accomplished a variety of jobs including: analysing data on the procedures undertaken in the hospital for marketing purposes; writing promotional leaflets for hospital services and working with an external design company to produce them; researching and setting up an email marketing system for advertising purposes; and posting internal finance reports and handling billing errors on the hospital computer system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this experience I developed abilities to efficiently and accurately learn and shoulder new roles in both an independent, and team-based capacity. It also provided invaluable experience of the structure and proceedings within a company and allowed me to advance my adaptability and interpersonal, creative, and problem-solving skills.

            Planning and organisation
          </h2>
          <p>
            Throughout both my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees I have had to undertake large volumes of work which have required a variety of cognitive and self-management skills. My undergraduate dissertation consisted of a 10,000-word independent research project requiring the management of a large assortment of academic material and data sources which demonstrates my proficiency in planning and organisation.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Research and written communication
          </h2>
          <p>
            I have conducted many research projects over the course of my degrees. These projects have included both group and individual work, the collection and analysis of both primary data and secondary data using a range of methodologies, and the critical synthesis of these data with relevant academic literature to present coherent and developed arguments.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Leadership and teamwork
          </h2>
          <p>
            I have achieved both the Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award and the Queen Scouts’ Challenge award as well as completed many of the modules of the Explorer Scout’s Young Leader Scheme. These activities enabled me to greatly develop my leadership, teamwork, and communication skills and continue to give me confidence to step into leadership roles.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Aptitude for learning new skills
          </h2>
          <p>
            Throughout both of my degrees and during my time at Spire Leeds, I have been required to rapidly learn new skills to complete projects and assignments to schedule. As an example, during my Masters I undertook a project which compared different methods of spatial analytic techniques to highlight geographies of crime. This required learning and implementing several statistical methods with which I was previous unfamiliar such as Gi* statistics, Kernel Density Estimation, and the Geographical Analysis Machine. I successfully achieved this and received a distinction for the assignment.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Analytical skills
          </h2>
          <p>
            Throughout my master’s I have undertaken a wide range of projects which demonstrate my ability to handle complex analytical tasks. These projects have covered a variety of topics such as the analysis of population estimates and projections in Israel-Palestine from 1900 to 2050, and the critical comparison of several different methods of spatial analysis to identify hot-spots of burglary in Leeds.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Problem-solving
          </h2>
          <p>
            I undertook several programming modules during my master’s degree which I greatly enjoyed and scored highly in. Bugs and errors within code are often difficult to notice and so locating and fixing such bugs has required me to develop a determined and methodical approach to problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also hold a full and completely clean UK driving licence.
