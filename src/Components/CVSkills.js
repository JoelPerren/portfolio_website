            <h3>Skills & Proficiencies</h3>
        </div>

        <div className="cv-content">
            <h3>Technical skills</h3>
            <p>I have a working knowledge of several programming languages and technologies including C, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and the ArcObjects Java SDK.</p>

            <h3>GIS skills</h3>
            <p>I have excellent knowledge and experience with desktop GIS platforms such as ArcMap and QGIS, as well as with web-based technologies such as the Google Maps JavaScript API and the Leaflet JavaScript library for producing online maps and web-GIS applications.</p>

            <h3>Analytical and Problem-solving Skills</h3>
            <p>Throughout my work at Fore Consulting and during my Masters degree, I have undertaken a wide range of projects which demonstrate my ability to undertake complex analytical tasks. Examples of these include developing a workflow to processes a years’ worth of ‘Trafficmaster’ data for use in the development of microsimulation models and the critical comparison of several different methods of spatial analysis to identify hot spots of burglary in Leeds. Through these experiences I have developed a systematic and inquisitive approach to work and am able to independently understand and solve complex problems.</p>

            <h3>Communication and Teamwork</h3>
            <p>My work at Fore Consulting has involved developing close working relationships with internal and external team members and other stakeholders such as Council highways officers and clients; I recognise that clear communication and effective teamwork is vital to providing the best possible service, minimising mistakes, and ensuring the efficient operation of the workplace. I have a concise and effective writing style and can clearly and confidently discuss and exchange ideas verbally.</p>

            <h3>Planning and Organisation</h3>
            <p>While working as a Transport Planner I frequently worked on several complex jobs at once. Ensuring that each job was completed to a high standard within deadlines required a well organised workflow and forward planning. I also required these skills during my Masters where I independently completed a 15,000-word dissertation which necessitated the management of a large assortment of academic material and data sources. The result was a detailed dissertation for which I received a mark of 87%.</p>

            <h3>Initiative and Adaptability</h3>
            <p>I am driven, adaptable, and willing to use my initiative to independently solve problems. When I joined Fore Consulting, I noticed that the methodology which was used to estimate of the distribution of vehicle trips from development sites was inefficient and unnecessarily time consuming. Using my knowledge of JavaScript and the Google Maps API, I developed a web application to automate this process so that rather than manually running and recording up to 200 direction queries on Google Maps manually, we are now able to run these queries in a batch process, greatly expediating the process.</p>

            <p>I also hold a full and clean UK driving licence.</p>
