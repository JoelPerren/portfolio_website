            A 'Ruthless Gerrymander' or 'Redressing Imbalance'? The Electoral Implications of the 2018 Boundary Review
          </h2>
          <p>
            For my Masters Dissertation, I analysed the likely impact that the initial proposals of the 2018 Westminster parliamentary boundary review would have had upon the results of the 2015 and 2017 general elections as well as the level of electoral bias present in each election. Ultimately, it sought to examine the boundary review would disproportionately benefit one party over another.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project involved two stages: Firstly, the results of the 2015 and 2017 elections were interpolated from the existing constituencies into the constituencies proposed by the 2018 review via a process of ‘dasymetric binary interpolation’. Secondly, the level and composition of electoral bias was calculated for both the actual and hypothetical elections in order to determine how this bias would be affected by the proposed constituencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was found that in both the 2015 and 2017 elections the initial constituencies proposed by the 2018 review would have improved the electoral prospects of the Conservative party at the expense of Labour and the Liberal Democrats. However, it was also found that the proposed constituencies would have significantly reduced the amount of electoral bias resulting from differences in electorate sizes between constituencies. It was concluded that much of the apparent benefit which the boundary review provided to the Conservatives resulted from reducing existing electoral bias which largely favours the Labour party currently.
