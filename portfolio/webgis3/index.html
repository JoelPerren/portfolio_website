            <h1>Mapping criminal damage and arson in Northumbria</h1>
            <p>Mapping point data onto an online map can be a useful method of data visualisation. It allows the user to see the location of an event and, through marker popups, allows the viewing of additional information relating to each event.</p>
            <p>However, as the size of the dataset increases, the limitations of a simple point map become increasingly apparent. Below is a map which plots the recorded locations of every crime categorised as 'criminal damage and arson' by the Northumbria Police in February 2017. Whilst this dataset contains 1,675 individual cases, it is just a small sub-set of the total dataset of recorded crimes for February 2017.</p>
            <p>Despite this, the map is of limited use due to the number of plotted events. In highly populated areas in particular, the density of points is so great so as to make the map illegible. This website explores a number of ways in which online maps can handle large volumes of data.</p>
            <p>The toolbar below offers several ways to visualise the data. It can be viewed as raw points, clusters of points, as a choropleth map, or as a heatmap. Accompanying each method of data visualisation is a brief commentary discussing the utility and limitation of each different visualisation method.</p>

                        <h2>Point map</h2>
                        <p>A basic point map is the simplest way of displaying data sets containing latitude and longitude information. It allows for a visualisation of the geographical distribution of the data as well as additional information contained within popups attached to each point.</p>
                        <p>While useful for smaller data sets, given a large amount of data they can quickly become unsuitable due to clutter. While this can be less on an issue with online maps as the user can dynamically adjust the scale, there is also an issue of performance to consider.</p>
                        <p>Adding many markers onto an online map slows the performance considerably. Although this can be mitigated (this map uses DivIcon markers rather than the default Leaflet markers to enhance performance), it remains a limitation and places constraints on the size of the data sets which can be presented.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mapdiscussion" id="clusterdiscussion">
                        <h2>Culstered point map</h2>
                        <p>Individual markers can be clustered into groups. When the user zooms in on a given cluster, the constituent points are revealed at which point the functionality is identical to that of the point map.</p>
                        <p>The advantage of this method is that visually the map is less cluttered and performance is significantly enhanced. All the same information is available to the user in a less overwhelming fashion.</p>
                        <p>However, at smaller scales, the immediate geographical pattern of the data can be harder to discern. The clusters show a much more generalised pattern which can make it harder to immediately understand the distribution of the data.</p>

                    <div class="mapdiscussion" id="choroplethdiscussion">
                        <h2>Choropleth map</h2>
                        <p>Aggregating the individual crime points into larger polygons and displaying them as a choropleth map is an effective method of reducing clutter while retaining the visibility of the geographical pattern of the data.</p>
                        <p>In this map, the crime events are aggregated into 2012 postcode district boundaries. Clicking on any given postcode displays its name and the number of crimes which occurred within its area.</p>
                        <p>As with any form of data which is aggregated into imposed geographical boundaries such as postcode districts, there is potential that the geographical pattern displayed in the data is a result of the boundaries which it is aggregated into, rather than a pattern in the data itself. This is known as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and is particularly noticeable in the larger postcode districts.</p>

                    <div class="mapdiscussion" id="heatdiscussion">
                        <h2>Heat map</h2>
                        <p>Instead of showing individual points, a heatmap smooths out the points into a surface layer.</p>
                        <p>Compared to the basic point map, this method provides a significantly clearer view of the geographical distribution of the data and has significantly better performance. Additionally, while the choropleth map also allows for a clearer view of the distribution, a heatmap is not affected by the issues of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem.</p>
                        <p>One issue, however, is the loss of individuality within the data. In heat map form, it is not possible to query the constituent points of the dataset to find information such as the outcome of a specific crime.</p>
