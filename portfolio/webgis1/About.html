	<p>The Leeds 'Blue Plaque Scheme' was set up by the Leeds Civic Trust in order to promote public awareness of the heritage of the city of Leeds. The first blue plaque was unveiled in 1987 and marks Burley Bar, one of the boundaries of the medieval town of Leeds<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>
	<p>This website displays all 107 of these plaques according to their location. Additional information such as the plaques title, inscription, and date of unveiling can be viewed by clicking on any of the pins on the map.</p>
	<p>Photos of the blue plaques shown on this website are available to be viewed <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/44067831@N00/sets/1439239/">here</a> - in a flickr album dedicated to the blue plaques in Leeds<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
	<p>Many other cities in the United Kingdom and around the world have blue plaque schemes of their own. These can be searched at <a href="http://openplaques.org/places">openplaques.org</a> - a website which has the most comprehensive list of blue plaques world-wide<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
